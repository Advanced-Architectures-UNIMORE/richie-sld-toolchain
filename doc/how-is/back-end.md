## Back-End
**WORK-IN-PROGRESS**
Python is exploited as a way of packaging a rendering environment for **templates** of different nature - RTL, C, yml, etc. To implement the functionalities required by such an environment we have decided to exploit the simple and straightfoward Mako template library [6].

The back-end flow is managed by `genacc.py` in the root folder.
