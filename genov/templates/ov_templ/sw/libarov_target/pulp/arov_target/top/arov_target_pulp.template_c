    Project:        GenOv

    Title:          Device API

    Description:    This class collects the templates which comply with 
                    a subsystem of the accelerator-rich SoC.

                    About the generation flow:

                    - The class object is imported and instantiated by 
                    the generation scripts under:

                        ==> 'genov/genov/generate_*.py'

                    - The object is then passed to a generator, which 
                    accomplishes the rendering phase. Generators are
                    defined under:

                        ==> 'genov/genov/python/SOMETHING-TO-RENDER/generator.py'
