## About the project
The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">**Richie toolchain**</span> is a System-Level Design (SLD) toolchain, aimed to automate and facilitate the hardware-software co-design of *Heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (HeSoCs)*, based on the accelerator-rich and many-core compute paradigms.
The SLD process goes from the design and integration of application-specific accelerators, platform optimization, generation and FPGA deployment.
The toolchain is part of the [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richie framework</span>](https://github.com/Advanced-Architectures-UNIMORE/richie), an open-source research project developed by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE) and based on the [PULP project](https://pulp-platform.org/index.html), a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.

## About this repository
This repository contains hardware, software and utilities to support the generation of a full-fledged HeSoC platform.
It is usually leveraged as a sub-repository of the [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richie framework</span>](https://github.com/Advanced-Architectures-UNIMORE/richie).
