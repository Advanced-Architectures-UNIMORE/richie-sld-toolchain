MMUL_TCDM is based on an IP generated with Vivado HLS with the inner kernel loop completely 
unrolled; thus, this is capable of performing a dot product between arrays of 512 elements
in two cycles (one for multiplication and one for accumulation). The IP is supposed to 
be deployed in a setup with "local" memories (e.g. TCDM).
