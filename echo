Checking overlay hardware subsystem...

...

A src/ directory has been found -> /usr/scratch/badile14/gbellocchi/workspace_pulp/hero/hardware/src
This location should comprise SystemVerilog source files to parametrize the PULP-based overlay system.

Is it a correct path?

...

A deps/ directory has been found -> /usr/scratch/badile14/gbellocchi/workspace_pulp/hero/hardware/deps
This location should comprise SystemVerilog dependencies. Basically, the overlay IPs (RISC-V core, DMA, HWPE accelerators, etc.).

Is it a correct path?

...

A test/ directory has been found -> /usr/scratch/badile14/gbellocchi/workspace_pulp/hero/hardware/test
This location comprises a SystemVerilog testbench to simulate the hardware behavior.

Is it a correct path?
